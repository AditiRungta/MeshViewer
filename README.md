# MeshViewer
The Mesh Viewer is an easy to use lightweight application for displaying three dimensional models (triangular meshes) with large poly counts. The Mesh Viewer is developed in OpenGL (with GLUT &amp; GLUI) and reads models specified in Hugues Hoppe's M file format. The triangle meshes can be rendered as solid, wireframe or point clouds and the loaded models can be translated, rotated and scaled using mouse controls. The model can be lighted using one or two light sources and the model can be viewed in orthogonal or perspective projection. Efficient performance of the Mesh Viewer was validated when it took a few milliseconds to load and render the Stanford bunny.
